/**
  * The system is event based so trades arrive at this consumer out of order.
  * To fix this issue, tradesStream must be sorted with the following rules:
  *
  * * SWAP trades are represented by two strings (i.e. 123CB SELL or 9898AA BUY), orderNumber and buySell respectively.
  *   - order numbers must be sorted lexicographically (i.e 11 before 11C)
  *   - Sells (SELL) must be processed before Buys (BUY) by stacking SELL/BUY pairs with the same orderNumber
  *
  * * CASH trades are represented by two numbers (i.e. 984756 34566), code and serial respectively.
  *   CASH trades must be processed in order of appearance, after all SWAPs are processed
  *
  * Please take a look at the test class for some examples
